This React app serves as a part of my portfolio and is created using Create React App, offering a swift setup for a React application.

## Quick Start
```
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AnaPaula74/my-portfolio.git
cd my-portfolio

 2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Run the development server:
npm start
This starts the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000. The page auto-reloads on code changes.
```
