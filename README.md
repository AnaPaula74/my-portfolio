This React app serves as a part of my portfolio and is created using Create React App, offering a swift setup for a React application.

## Quick Start

#### 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-react-app.git
cd your-react-app

#### 2. Install dependencies:
npm install

#### 3. Run the development server:
npm start
This starts the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000. The page auto-reloads on code changes.
